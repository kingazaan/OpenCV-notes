Goal is tomake an openCV app that can play and move to next/previous song in spotify.
Broken down:

1. Be able to open Spotify,and play songs in itor skip songs/whateber
2. be able to have openCV do things when you want it to (aka movoingl your hand changes SOMETHING)
3. link these together so movement in openCV can skip songs and stuff
